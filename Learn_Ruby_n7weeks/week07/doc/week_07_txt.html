<p>Final Week Tutorial</p>

<p>Before you begin:  First complete: Weeks 1 to 6</p>

<p>Final Week:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>You need to read through the following pages.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>While doing so, please make a note of all your doubts, queries, questions,
clarifications and after you have  completed all the pages, post these on
the forum here.  There may be some questions that relate to something that
has not been mentioned or discussed by me here;  you could post the same
too.</p>

<p><a href="Duck.html">Duck</a> Typing Ruby Syntactic Sugar Mutable and
Immutable Objects Freezing Objects frozen? <a href="Object.html">Object</a>
Serialization Modules/Mixins Self Top level context Self inside class and
module definitions Self in instance method definitions Self in
singleton-method and class-method definitions Constants</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Some of the important points to remember after you have read through the
above pages are:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>In Ruby, we rely less on the type (or class) of an object and more on its
capabilities.  Hence, <a href="Duck.html">Duck</a> Typing means an object
type is defined by what it can do, not by what it is. <a
href="Duck.html">Duck</a> Typing refers to the tendency of Ruby to be less
concerned with the class of an object and more  concerned with what methods
can be called on it and what operations can be performed on it.</p>

<p>In Ruby, we would use respond_to? or might simply pass an object to a
method and know that an exception  will be raised if it is used
inappropriately.</p>

<p>Syntactic sugar refer to special rules that let you write your code in a
way that doesn&#39;t correspond to  the normal rules but that is easier to
remember how to do and looks better.</p>

<p>Ruby allows you to define methods that end with an equal sign (=)</p>

<p>Mutable objects are objects whose state can change. Immutable objects are
objects whose state never changes after creation. Mutability is a property
of an instance, not of an entire class.  Any instance can become immutable
by calling freeze. The freeze method in class <a
href="Object.html">Object</a> prevents you from changing an object,
effectively turning an object into a constant.  After we freeze an object,
an attempt to modify it results in TypeError. freeze operates on an object
reference, not on a variable.  This means that any operation resulting in a
new object will work. A method frozen? tells you whether an object is
frozen or not.</p>

<p>Ruby Modules are similar to classes in that they hold a collection of
methods, constants,  and other module and class definitions.  Unlike
classes, you cannot create objects based on modules; instead, you specify
that you want the  functionality of a particular module to be added to the
functionality of a class, or of a specific object. Modules serve two
purposes: First they act as namespace, letting you define methods whose
names will not  clash with those defined elsewhere.  Second, they allow you
to share functionality between classes - if a class mixes in a module, 
that module&#39;s instance methods become available as if they had been
defined in the class.  They get mixed in.</p>

<p>SYNTAX OF require/load VS. SYNTAX OF include - You may have noticed that
when you use require or load,  you put the name of the item you&#39;re
requiring or loading in quotation marks, but with include, you don&#39;t. 
require and load take strings as their arguments, whereas include takes the
name of a module, in the form of a constant.  The requirements to require
and load are usually literal strings (in quotation marks),  but a string in
a variable will also work.</p>

<p>The main difference between inheriting from a class and mixing in a module
is that you can mix in more than one module.  No class can inherit from
more than one class. Class names tend to be nouns, while module names are
often adjectives (like Stack versus Stacklike). At every point when your
program is running, there is one and only one self - the current or default
object  accessible to you in your program. Please note the rules given for
self in the Self related page. Thus self (current object) is the default
receiver of method calls and self (current object)  is where instance
variables are found.</p>

<p>Java features the ability to serialize objects, letting you store them
somewhere and reconstitute them when needed.  Ruby calls this kind of
serialization marshaling. Marshal.dump is used to save a serialized version
of an object. Marshal.load is used to read in from a serialized object. A
Ruby constant is a reference to an object. Although constants should not be
changed, you can modify the internal states of the objects they reference.
Remember the rules for constants.</p>

<p>Exercises:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please complete the last week exercises and discuss in the last week forum.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Quiz:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please take the quiz after you have completed the last week.  All the
questions are either of multiple-choice and/or true/false and based on what
you have learned in this week.  You have only 2 attempts to complete the
quiz. Grades will be allotted for the quiz.</p>
