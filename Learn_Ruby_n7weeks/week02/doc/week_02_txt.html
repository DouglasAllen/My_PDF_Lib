<p>Before you begin:  First complete: Week 1.</p>

<p>REMEMBER: No question is too silly to ask. Just ask it in the relevant
forums. Have you all been solving the exercises that have been given on the
relevant pages?  Let me know whether you are able to solve the same or
having problems. Week 2</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>You need to read through the following pages, in the given order.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>While doing so, please make a note of all your doubts, queries, questions,
clarifications and after you have  completed all the pages, post these on
the forum here.  There may be some questions that relate to something that
has not been mentioned or discussed by me here;  you could post the same
too.</p>

<p>Ruby ri Tool More on Strings Simple Constructs Ruby Blocks</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Some of the important points to remember after you have read through the
above pages are:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Refer to the String documentation to use the various methods available. For
double-quoted string literals, Ruby looks for substitutions - sequences
that start with a backslash character -  and replaces them with some binary
value or does expression interpolation ie. within the string,  the sequence
#{expression} is replaced by the value of the expression. It is to be noted
that every time a string literal is used in an assignment or as a
parameter,  a new String object is created. %w is a common usage in
strings. Observe how one can list all the methods of a class or object.
Comparing two strings for equality can be done by == or .eql? (for
identical content) and .equal?  (for identical objects). Observe the usage
of constructs: if else end, while, if elsif end Case Expressions: This form
is fairly close to a series of if statements: it lets you list a series of 
conditions and execute a statement corresponding to the first one
that&#39;s true. case returns the value of the  last expression executed.
Usage: case when else end Ruby also has a negated form of the if statement,
the unless end. IMPORTANT: I&#39;d suggest that you read the topic “Ruby
Blocks” a couple of times,  as it&#39;s an extremely important topic and
used everywhere in Ruby.  Ruby Code blocks are chunks of code between
braces or between do- end that you can associate with method invocations. 
Code blocks may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call;  the
block is written starting on the same line as the method call&#39;s last
parameter  (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list).  The code in
the block is not executed at the time it is encountered.  Instead, Ruby
remembers the context in which the block appears (the local variables, the
current object, and so on)  and then enters the method.</p>

<p>The Ruby standard is to use braces for single-line blocks and do- end for
multi-line blocks.  Keep in mind that the braces syntax has a higher
precedence than the do..end syntax.</p>

<p>Inside a method, you can call a Ruby block using the yield keyword with a
value.</p>

<p>You can provide parameters to the call to yield: these will be passed to
the block.  Within the block, you list the names of the arguments to
receive the parameters between vertical bars (|).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Exercises:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please complete the Week 2 exercises and discuss in the Week 2 forum.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Quiz:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please take the quiz after you have completed Week 2.  All the questions
are either of multiple-choice and/or true/false and based on what you have
learned in Week 2.  You have only 2 attempts to complete the same. Grades
will be allotted for the quiz.</p>
