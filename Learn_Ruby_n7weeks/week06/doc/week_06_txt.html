<p>Week 6: Tutorial</p>

<p>Before you begin:  First complete: Weeks 1 to 5</p>

<p>Week 6:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>You need to read through the following pages.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>While doing so, please make a note of all your doubts, queries, questions,
clarifications and after you have  completed all the pages, post these on
the forum here.  There may be some questions that relate to something that
has not been mentioned or discussed by me here;  you could post the same
too.</p>

<p>Access Control Exceptions Ruby Logging Time class</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Some of the important points to remember after you have read through the
above pages are:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Ruby gives you three levels of protection: public - methods can be called
by everyone. A class&#39;s instance methods are public by default.
protected - methods can be invoked only by objects of the defining class
and its subclasses. private - methods cannot be called with an that private
methods can be called only in the context  of the current object.explicit
receiver - the receiver is always self.  This means The initialize method
is always private.</p>

<p>Access control is determined dynamically, as the program runs, not
statically.  You will get an access violation only when the code attempts
to execute the restricted method. Top-level methods are private instance
methods of the Kernel module.</p>

<p>attr_reader is reader only; attr_writer is writer only and attr_accessor is
both reader and writer.</p>

<p>An exception is a special kind of object, an instance of the class
Exception or a descendant of that class. The raise method is from the
Kernel module.  By default, raise creates an exception of the RuntimeError
class.  To raise an exception of a specific class, you can pass in the
class name as an argument to raise. To do exception handling, we enclose
the code that could raise an exception in a begin-end block and use  one or
more rescue clauses to tell Ruby the types of exceptions we want to handle.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the body of a method definition is an implicit
begin-end block;  the begin is omitted, and the entire body of the method
is subject to exception handling,  ending with the end of the method. If
you write a rescue clause with no parameter list, the parameter defaults to
StandardError.</p>

<p>If you need the guarantee that some processing is done at the end of a
block of code,  regardless of whether an exception was raised then the
ensure clause can be used.  ensure goes after the last rescue clause and
contains a chunk of code that will always be executed  as the block
terminates. The ensure block will always run.</p>

<p>By default, the inspect message, which can be sent to any object, formats
the object&#39;s ID and instance variables.  It returns a string containing
a human-readable representation of object.  If not overridden, uses the
to_s method to generate the string. The Time class contains Ruby&#39;s
interface to the set of time libraries written in <a href="C.html">C</a>.
Time zero for Ruby is the first second GMT of January 1, 1970. Ruby&#39;s
DateTime class is superior to Time for astronomical and historical
applications,  but you can use Time for most everyday programs.</p>

<p>Exercises:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please complete the Week 6 exercises and discuss in the Week 6 forum.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Quiz:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please take the quiz after you have completed Week 6.  All the questions
are either of multiple-choice and/or true/false and based on what you have
learned in Week 6.  You have only 2 attempts to complete the quiz. Grades
will be allotted for the quiz.</p>
