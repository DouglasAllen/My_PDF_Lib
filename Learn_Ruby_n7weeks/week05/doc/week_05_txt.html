<p>Before you begin</p>

<p>First complete: Week 1 to 4.</p>

<p>Week 5</p>

<p>You need to read through the following pages.  While doing so, please make
a note of all your doubts, queries, questions, clarifications and after you
have  completed all the pages, post these on the forum here.  There may be
some questions that relate to something that has not been mentioned or
discussed by me here;  you could post the same too.</p>

<p>Including Other Files in Ruby Ruby Open Classes Inheritance Overriding
Methods Overloading Methods</p>

<p>Some of the important points to remember after you have read through the
above page are:</p>

<p>The load method includes the named Ruby source file every time the method
is executed. The more commonly used require method loads any given file
only once. Note that you say require &#39;filename&#39;, not require
&#39;filename.rb&#39;.</p>

<p>In Ruby, classes are never closed: you can always add methods to an
existing class. This applies to the classes you write as well as the
standard, built-in classes.  All you have to do is open up a class
definition for an existing class,  and the new contents you specify will be
added to whatever&#39;s there.</p>

<p>The benefit of inheritance is that classes lower down the hierarchy get the
features of those higher up,  but can also add specific features of their
own. In Ruby, a class can only inherit from a single other class. The
Object class is the parent class of all classes in Ruby.  Its methods are
therefore available to all objects unless explicitly overridden.</p>

<p>Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of
a method that is already provided  by one of its superclasses.  The
implementation in the subclass overrides (replaces) the implementation in
the superclass.</p>

<p>Nothing stops you from defining a method twice, however the new version
takes precedence. When you invoke super with no arguments Ruby sends a
message to the parent of the current object,  asking it to invoke a method
of the same name as the method invoking super.  It automatically forwards
the arguments that were passed to the method from which it&#39;s called.
Called with an empty argument list - super() - it sends no arguments to the
higher-up method,  even if arguments were passed to the current method.
Called with specific arguments - super(a, b, c) - it sends exactly those
arguments.</p>

name.</p>

<p>Sample program covering everything we have learned so far in Classes and
Objects  (please ensure that all the following programs are stored in the
same folder):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Exercises:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please complete the Week 5 exercises and discuss in the Week 5 forum.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Quiz:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please take the quiz after you have completed Week 5.  All the questions
are either of multiple-choice and/or true/false and based on what you have
learned in Week 5.  You have only 2 attempts to complete the quiz. Grades
will be allotted for the quiz.</p>
