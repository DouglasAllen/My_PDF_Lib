<p>Before you begin</p>

<p>First complete: Weeks 1 to 3.</p>

<p>Week 4</p>

<p>During Weeks 1 to 3 the procedural style of programming (this continues to
be used in languages such as C)  was used to write our programs.
Programming procedurally means you focus on the steps required to complete
a task without paying particular  attention to how the data is managed.</p>

<p>I shall introduce you to Regular Expressions. Many people find regular
expressions difficult to use, difficult to read, un-maintainable, and
ultimately  counterproductive. You may end up using only a modest number of
regular expressions in your Ruby and Rails applications. Becoming a regular
expression wizard isn&#39;t a prerequisite for Rails programming. However,
it&#39;s advisable to learn at least the basics of how regular expressions
work.</p>

<p>Apart from Regular Expressions, this week, we shall be doing three more
lessons as we want to understand and  absorb what we read about Classes and
Objects.</p>

<p>You need to read through the following pages.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions Writing our own Class in Ruby Method Missing Ruby Procs</p>

<p>While doing so, please make a note of all your doubts, queries, questions,
clarifications and after you have  completed all the pages, post these on
the forum here. There may be some questions that relate to something that
has not been mentioned or discussed by me here;  you could post the same
too.</p>

<p>Some of the important points to remember after you have read through the
above pages are:</p>

<p>Regular expressions, though cryptic, is a powerful tool for working with
text. Ruby has this feature built-in. It&#39;s used for pattern-matching
and text processing. Many people find regular expressions difficult to use,
difficult to read, un-maintainable, and ultimately counterproductive. You
may end up using only a modest number of regular expressions in your Ruby
and Rails applications. Becoming a regular expression wizard isn&#39;t a
prerequisite for Rails programming. It&#39;s advisable to learn at least
the basics of how regular expressions work. A regular expression is simply
a way of specifying a pattern of characters to be matched in a string. In
Ruby, you typically create a regular expression by writing a pattern
between slash characters (/pattern/). In Ruby, regular expressions are
objects (of type Regexp) and can be manipulated as such.</p>

<pre>// is a regular expression and an instance of the Regexp class.</pre>

<p>An object is an entity that serves as a container for data and also
controls access to the data. Associated with an object is a set of
attributes, which are essentially no more than variables belonging to that
object. Also associated with an object is a set of functions that provide
an interface to the functionality of  the object, called methods. Things an
object knows about itself are called instance variables. They represent an
object&#39;s state (the data - for example, the quantity and the product
id),  and can have unique values for each object of that type. Things an
object can do are called methods. An object is a combination of state and
methods that use the state.</p>

<p>A class is used to construct an object. A class is a blueprint for an
object. More than 30 built-in classes are predefined in the Ruby class
hierarchy. The following class hierarchy is important, In Ruby, everything
from an integer to a string is  considered to be an object. And each object
has built in &#39;methods&#39; (Ruby term for functions) which can be used
to do various useful things.</p>

<p>To use a method, you need to put a dot after the object, and then append
the method name. Some methods such as puts and gets are available
everywhere and don&#39;t need to be associated with a specific object.
Technically speaking, these methods are provided by Ruby&#39;s Kernel
module (more on this later) and they are  included in all Ruby objects (the
Kernel module is included by class <a href="Object.html">Object</a>, so its
methods are available in  every Ruby object).</p>

<p>When you run a Ruby application, an object called main of class <a
href="Object.html">Object</a> is automatically created. This object
provides access to the Kernel methods. Ruby integers are objects of class
Fixnum or Bignum. The Fixnum and Bignum classes represent integers of
differing sizes. Both classes descend from Integer (and therefore Numeric).
The floating-point numbers are objects of class Float, corresponding to the
native architecture&#39;s double data type. A new class is defined
typically using class Name … end Classes in Ruby are first-class objects -
each is an instance of class Class.</p>

<p>MUG THIS UP Class is an object, and <a href="Object.html">Object</a> is a
class.“ Hal Fulton</p>

<p>When a new class is defined say Name, an object of type Class is created
and assigned to a constant (Name. in this case). When Name.new is called to
create a new object,  the new class method in Class is run by default, 
which in turn invokes allocate to allocate memory for the object,  before
finally calling the new object&#39;s initialize method. The constructing
and initializing phases of an object are separate and both can be
over-ridden. The initialization is done via the initialize instance method
while the construction is done via the new class method. Initialize is not
a constructor! Objects are created on the heap.</p>

<p>In the statement:  d = <a
href="Dog.html#method-c-new">Dog.new</a>(&#39;Labrador&#39;,
&#39;Benzy&#39;)</p>

<p>The variable d is known as a reference variable. It does not hold the
object itself, but it holds something like a pointer or an address of the
object. You use the dot operator (.) on a reference variable to say,  “use
the thing before the dot to get me the thing after the dot.”</p>

<p>For example:  d.bark</p>

<p>As soon as an object comes into existence, it already responds to a number
of messages. Every object is “born” with certain innate abilities. To see a
list of innate methods, you can call the methods method:  puts d.methods 
The result is a list of all the messages (methods) this newly minted object
comes bundled with.</p>

<p>Amongst these many methods, the methods object_id and respond_to? are
important. Every object in Ruby has a unique id number associated with it
that can be found by the method object_id. You can determine in advance
(before you ask the object to do something) whether the object knows how to
handle  the message you want to send it, by using the respond_to? method.
You can ask any object of which class it&#39;s a member by using its
Object.class method. instance_of? returns true if object is an instance of
the given class. Literal &#39;Constructors&#39; means you can use special
notation, instead of a call to new,  to create a new object of that class.</p>

<p>Look at the example given for String. Symbol, Array, Hash, Range, Regexp
Garbage Collection (GC): The Ruby object heap allocates a minimum of 8
megabytes. Ruby&#39;s GC is called mark-and-sweep. The “mark” stage checks
objects to see if they are still in use. If an object is in a variable that
can still be used in the current scope,  the object (and any object inside
that object) is marked for keeping. If the variable is long gone, off in
another method, the object isn&#39;t marked. The “sweep” stage then frees
objects which haven&#39;t been marked. Ruby uses a conservative
mark-and-sweep GC mechanism. There is no guarantee that an object will
undergo garbage collection before the program terminates. Variables are
used to hold references to objects.</p>

<p>Variables themselves have no type, nor are they objects themselves.</p>

<p>method_missing gives you a way to intercept unanswerable messages and
handle them gracefully.</p>

<p>Blocks are not objects, but they can be converted into objects of class
Proc. This can be done by calling the lambda method of the module Kernel.
Remember you cannot pass methods into other methods (but you can pass procs
into methods),  and methods cannot return other methods (but they can
return procs).</p>

<p>Exercises: Please complete the Week 4 exercises and discuss in the Week 4
forum.</p>

<p>Quiz: Please take the quiz after you have completed Week 4.</p>

<p>All the questions are either of multiple-choice and/or true/false and based
on what you have learned in Week 4. You have only 2 attempts to complete
the quiz. Grades will be allotted for the quiz.</p>
