<p>*PARALLEL TRACK* Understand HTTP concepts</p>

<p>When you start building web applications, you would be dealing with HTTP a
lot.</p>

<p>What’s HTTP?</p>

<p>HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. A protocol is just a convention for
computer dialogs. It assumes that the computers participating in the
conversation have a way of sending messages to each other.</p>

<p>HTTP uses a simple conversation pattern: the client connects to the server,
initiates the dialog by asking the server for something, the server then
tries to provide the client with an answer (back).</p>

<p>An example of a simple HTTP request and response would be the client asking
“give me the file A” and the server answering “I have it, here is the
content of file A: (…content of file A…)”.</p>

<p>But in reality the protocol uses its own simplified language which looks
more like “GET /fileA” answered by “200 OK (…content of file A…)”.</p>

<p>HTTP Loading a web page When a browser loads a web page, it does a GET
request for the URL requested. The content of the page is usually in a
special text format called HTML that allows links, images and various style
effects.</p>

<p>The browser analyses the HTML in order to display it to the user. But doing
so, it may find that it needs more content to render the page correctly,
like images.</p>

<p>When that happens, the browser initiates one HTTP request for each image.</p>

<p>When all the necessary information is downloaded, it is combined into the
page the user sees on his screen.</p>

<p>HTTP HTTP request methods (verbs)</p>

<p>GET A resource is some chunk of information that can be identified by a URL
(it&#39;s the R in URL - Uniform Resource Locator). The most common kind of
resource is a file, but a resource may also be a dynamically-generated
query result, a document that is available in several languages, or
something else.</p>

<p>GET is the most common HTTP method; it says “give me this resource”. Method
names are always uppercase.</p>

<p>A typical request looks like this:</p>

<p>GET /path/to/file/index.html HTTP/1.0 The path is the part of the URL after
the host name, also called the request URI (a URI is like a URL, but more
general).</p>

<p>The HTTP version always takes the form “HTTP/x.x”, uppercase.</p>

<p>POST A POST request is used to send data to the server to be processed in
some way. A POST request is different from a GET request in the following
ways:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a block of data sent with the request, in the message body. The
request URI is not a resource to retrieve; it&#39;s usually a program to
handle the data you&#39;re sending. The HTTP response is normally program
output, not a static file. PUT A PUT request uploads a document from either
the local file system or a remote HTTP server to the destination HTTP
server.</p>

<p>DELETE A DELETE request deletes a resource (or makes it unavailable) for
future references.</p>

<p>HTTP response codes</p>

<p>After a client (such as a web browser) sends a request corresponding to one
of the HTTP verbs, the web server responds with a numerical code indicating
the HTTP status of the response. For example, a status code of 200 means
“success”, and a status code of 301 means “permanent redirect”. If you
install curl (when you installed the Bash shell, curl was also installed),
a command-line client that can issue HTTP requests, you can see this
directly at, e.g., <a href="www.satishtalim.com">www.satishtalim.com</a>
(where the –head flag prevents curl from returning the whole page). Open a
Bash shell and type:</p>

<p>$ curl –head <a href="www.satishtalim.com">www.satishtalim.com</a></p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
.
.
.</pre>

<p>Here satishtalim.com indicates that the request was successful by returning
the status 200 OK. In contrast, google.com is permanently redirected (to <a
href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, naturally), indicated by status
code 301 (a “301 redirect”):</p>

<p>$ curl –head rubylearning.org</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://www.google.com/
.
