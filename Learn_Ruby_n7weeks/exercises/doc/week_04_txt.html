<p>Try and write your code with whatever Ruby we have learned so far.</p>

<p>Exercise1. Write a class called Dog, that has name as an instance variable
and the following methods:</p>

<p>bark(), eat(), chase_cat() I shall create the Dog object as follows: d =
Dog.new(&#39;Leo&#39;)</p>

<p>Exercise1A (optional). Here&#39;s an additional challenge for all of you
who already finished Exercise1:</p>

<pre>Write a method teach_trick which allows you to teach tricks to specific instances of the dog class like this:</pre>

<p>d = Dog.new(&#39;Lassie&#39;) d.teach_trick(:dance) { “#{@name} is
dancing!” } puts d.dance d.teach_trick(:poo) { “#{@name} is a smelly
doggy!” } puts d.poo puts d2=Dog.new(&#39;Fido&#39;) puts d2.dance
d2.teach_trick(:laugh) { “#{@name} finds this hilarious!” } puts d2.laugh
puts d.laugh puts d3=Dog.new(&#39;Stimpy&#39;) puts d3.dance puts d3.laugh
# &gt;&gt; Lassie is dancing! # &gt;&gt; Lassie is a smelly doggy! #
&gt;&gt; # &gt;&gt; Fido doesn&#39;t know how to dance! # &gt;&gt; Fido
finds this hilarious! # &gt;&gt; Lassie doesn&#39;t know how to laugh! #
&gt;&gt; # &gt;&gt; Stimpy doesn&#39;t know how to dance! # &gt;&gt; Stimpy
doesn&#39;t know how to laugh! You will also have to deal with the fact
that people may get confused and will tell a certain dog  to perform a
trick it hasn&#39;t learned yet…</p>

<p>Exercise2. Write a <a href="Rectangle.html">Rectangle</a> class. I shall
use your class as follows:</p>

<p>r = <a href="Rectangle.html#method-c-new">Rectangle.new</a>(23.45, 34.67)
puts “Area is = #{r.area}” puts “Perimeter is = #{r.perimeter}”</p>

<p>Exercise3. Call this program (p026zdeafgm2.rb) - Modify your Deaf Grandma
program (Week 3 / Exercise6): What if grandma doesn&#39;t want you to
leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. Change your
previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make
sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not in a row,
you should still be talking to grandma. You must shout BYE three separate
times. If you shout BYEBYEBYE or BYE BYE BYE, grandma should pretend not to
hear you  (and not count it as a BYE). This program does not solve this
exercise.  But now that we have read a little bit about Procs and lambda, I
thought I would show this program…</p>

<p>def intro</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-value">&lt;&lt;-EOS
Granny is having a hard time hearing lately, as her Dura-Gizers are dead for her hearing aids
So you will want to yell (ALL CAPS) to have her hear you.
EOS</span>
</pre>

<p>end granny = -&gt;(what_was_said, years_remembered = [*(1930..1950)]) do</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">what_was_said</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">upcase</span> <span class="ruby-operator">==</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">what_was_said</span> <span class="ruby-operator">?</span>
  <span class="ruby-node">&quot;No, Sonny.  At least not since #{years_remembered.sample}.&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-operator">:</span>
  <span class="ruby-string">&quot;HUH?  SPEAK UP SONNY!&quot;</span>
</pre>

<p>end puts intro until &#39;BYE&#39; == sonny_says = gets.chomp</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">granny</span>[<span class="ruby-identifier">sonny_says</span>] <span class="ruby-keyword">unless</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">sonny_says</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">empty?</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Say something to Granny:&quot;</span>
</pre>

<p>end From Chris Pine&#39;s Book.</p>

<p>Exercise4. Write a Ruby program (call it p028swapcontents.rb) to do the
following.</p>

<pre>Take two text files say A and B. The program should swap the contents of A and B.
That is after the program is executed, A should contain B&#39;s contents and B should contains A&#39;s contents.</pre>

<p>Exercise5. Difficulty level: MEDIUM Write a one-line Ruby script that
displays on the screen all the files in the current folder  as well as
everything in all its sub folders, in sorted order.</p>

<p>Make use of Dir.glob method as follows:
Dir.glob(&#39;*<strong>/</strong>&#39;) Name this program inventory.rb.</p>

<pre>Create an inventory file by typing the following at the command prompt:</pre>

<p>ruby inventory.rb &gt; <a
href="old-inventory_txt.html">old-inventory.txt</a></p>

<p>After a few days, when some files would have been added / deleted from this
folder, run the program again like: ruby inventory.rb &gt; <a
href="new-inventory_txt.html">new-inventory.txt</a></p>

<p>Now, write another Ruby script that displays on the screen all the files
that have been added in this folder since the time</p>

<pre>the old-inventory.txt was created.</pre>

<p>Discuss these exercises in the Week 4 forum.</p>
