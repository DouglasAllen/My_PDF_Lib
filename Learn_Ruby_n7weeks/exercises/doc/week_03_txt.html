<p>Try and write your code with whatever Ruby we have learned so far.</p>

<p>Exercise1. Why is the output of this program:</p>

<p>def method</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">a</span> = <span class="ruby-value">50</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>
</pre>

<p>end a = 10 method puts a as shown below:</p>

<p>50 10</p>

<p>Exercise2. Thanks to Marcos Souza for this exercise. A plain text file has
the following contents:</p>

<p>test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test
test test test test test test test test test test test test word test test
test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test
test test test test test test test test test test Observe that in this
file, there exists a word &#39;word&#39;. Write a clever but readable Ruby
program that updates this file and the final contents become like this:
test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test
test test test test test test test test test test test test inserted word
test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test
test test test test test test test test test test test test Do not
hard-code the file name.</p>

<p>Exercise3. Make use of the class Dir for the following -</p>

<p>Display your current working directory. Create a new directory tmp under
your working directory. Change your working directory to tmp Display your
current working directory. Go back to your original directory. Delete the
tmp directory.</p>

<p>Exercise4. Given the following Ruby code snippet:</p>

<p>a = (1930…1951).to_a puts <a href="rand(a.size)">a</a> When you run this
program, which of the following values will not be displayed? 1929 1930
1945 1950 1951 1952 Explain why that value will not be displayed.</p>

<p>Also, have a look at the splat operator:</p>

<p>a = [*1930…1951] # splat operator</p>

<p>Exercise5. Given a string s = &#39;key=value&#39;, create two strings s1
and s2 such that s1 contains key and s2 contains value. Hint: Use some of
the <a href="String.html">String</a> functions.</p>

<p>Exercise6. Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma
(whatever you type in), she should respond with HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!,
unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you
(or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! To make
your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each
time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. You can&#39;t stop
talking to grandma until you shout BYE.</p>

<p>Adapted from Chris Pine&#39;s Book.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>You enter: Hello Grandma Grandma responds: HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY! You
enter: HELLO GRANDMA Grandma responds: NO, NOT SINCE 1938!</p>

<p>Exercise7. First of all, I&#39;d like to thank Peter Cooper for allowing me
to use this exercise.</p>

<p>The application you&#39;re going to develop will be a text analyzer. You
will be working on it this and next week. Your Ruby code will read in text
supplied in a separate file, analyze it for various patterns and
statistics, and print out the results for the user. It&#39;s not a 3D
graphical adventure or a fancy Web site, but text processing programs are
the bread and butter of systems administration and most application
development. They can be vital for parsing log files and user-submitted
text on Web sites, and manipulating other textual data. With this
application you&#39;ll be focusing on implementing the features quickly,
rather than developing an elaborate object-oriented structure, any
documentation, or a testing methodology.</p>

<p>Your text analyzer will provide the following basic statistics:</p>

<p>Character count Character count (excluding spaces) Line count Word count
Sentence count Paragraph count Average number of words per sentence Average
number of sentences per paragraph In the last two cases, the statistics are
easily calculated from the word count, sentence count, and paragraph count.
That is, once you have the total number of words and the total number of
sentences, it becomes a matter of a simple division to work out the average
number of words per sentence.</p>

<p>Before you start to code, the first step is to get some test data that your
analyzer can process. You can find the text at: <a
href="http://rubylearning.com/data/text.txt">rubylearning.com/data/text.txt</a></p>

<p>Save the file in the same folder as your other Ruby programs and call it
text.txt. Your application will read from <a
href="text_txt.html">text.txt</a> by default (although you&#39;ll make it
more dynamic and able to accept other sources of data later on).</p>

<p>Let me outline the basic steps you need to follow:</p>

<p>Load in a file containing the text or document you want to analyze. As you
load the file line by line, keep a count of how many lines there are (one
of your statistics taken care of). Put the text into a string and measure
its length to get your character count. Temporarily remove all whitespace
and measure the length of the resulting string to get the character count
excluding spaces. Split on whitespace to find out how many words there are.
Split on full stops (.), &#39;!&#39; and &#39;?&#39; to find out how many
sentences there are. Split on double newlines to find out how many
paragraphs there are. Perform calculations to work out the averages. Create
a new, blank Ruby source file and save it as analyzer.rb in your Ruby
folder.</p>

<p>Exercise8. Write a Ruby program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.</p>

<pre>But for multiples of three print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number and for multiples of five print &quot;Buzz&quot;. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;. 
Discuss this in the FizzBuzz Forum.</pre>

<p>Exercise9. Given a string, write a program to reverse the word order
(rather than character order). The <a href="String.html">String</a> and
Array classes provide methods which will be very helpful for solving this
exercise.</p>

<p>Exercise10. Write a Ruby program that, when given an array: collection =
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] calculates the sum of its elements.</p>

<p>Exercise11. Write a Ruby program that, when given an array: collection =
[12, 23, 456, 123, 4579] prints each number, and tells you whether it is
odd or even.</p>

<p>Exercise12. Something to keep your grey cells ticking.</p>

<p>I have a database of all the course participants. I want to know the number
of participants who have not attempted Quiz 1 (is it so scary ?). A student
writes a clever Ruby program that creates an array of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.
0&#39;s indicate that the participant has not attempted the Quiz and the
1&#39;s have attempted it.</p>

<p>Use this array quiz:</p>

<p>quiz = [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1] and write another clever program to solve my
problem. That is display thenumber of participants who have not attempted
Quiz 1.</p>

<p>The output of your program should be as follow: The number of participants
who did not attempt Quiz 1 is x out of y total participants.</p>

<p>Exercise13 Ruby is a DRY language.  Ruby helps you keep your code short and
concise.  DRY stands for: Don’t Repeat Yourself Syntactically, it’s a very
efficient language: you can express the same thing with less lines of code.
As we know, computers are fast enough that more lines of code do not slow
them down. But what about you?  When it comes to debugging and maintaining,
the more code you have to deal with, the harder it is to see what it does
and find the problems that need fixing. Here&#39;s some code:</p>

<p># The long way record = Hash.new <a href=":name">record</a> = “Satish” <a
href=":email">record</a> = “mail@satishtalim.com” <a
href=":phone">record</a> = “919371006659” Rewrite, the above code in one
line, the DRY (or Ruby) way. Exercise14 The next set of exercises are
sample questions from the Important Ruby Association Certified Ruby
Programmer examination. Thanks to Satoshi Asakawa for the Japanese to
English translation.</p>
